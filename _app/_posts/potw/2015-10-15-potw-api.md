*[View problem](http://potw.quinnftw.com/problem/2015/5/)*

## The Problem

Given an endpoint for a JSON API, pull the data from it and translate it into 
a graph.

## What is an API?

- API stands for *Application programming interface*
- Basically an API is an interface that a system can expose that allows 
others to access some chosen internal data/functions
- For example, you may create a stack class and expose an API for pushing and 
popping, but still hide away your internal node structure
- [potw.quinnftw.com/api/solvers](http://potw.quinnftw.com/api/solvers) exposes 
a view of the websites internal scoring system

## How do we use it?

- We can get the data from the API using an HTTP GET request
    - Called a GET request because it is used to retrieve data
    - POST, PATCH, and DELETE are also types of requests (self explanitory)
- Almost every language has a library for making GET requests
- Simply make a request to the URL and you will recieve the data displayed on the page

## Parsing the data

- The data is displayed in JSON format
    - JSON stands for *Javascript Object Notation*
    - The format in which javascript serializes its objects
- Again, most languages have a JSON parser in the standard library
- I choose to use Javascript so that there would be a direct native translation

## Making a request in Javascript

- Making GET requests in node.js is very simple
- Key concept to remember is that *all* I/O (file, keyboard, network, etc.) in node.js
is asynchronous
    - This means that it is non-blocking
    - i.e. program continues execution normally after function is called
    - I/O is performed concurrently

## Dealing with asynchronous I/O

- I/O in node.js uses *callbacks* to communicate data between concurrent functions
- A callback is a function which is defined in the main execution space, and 
is passed to an asynchronous call as a means of returning the data
- Simple return statements are useless since execution is asynchronous
    - We can't "wait" for a return value because functions do not block

## The code

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Quinny/75f1fe5551e31221fc44.js"></script>

## Explained

- This code allows us to make our request to the server asynchronously
- We provide a callback function ``drawGraph`` so that we can use the data received
in the I/O call
