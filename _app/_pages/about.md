I currently work as a Software Engineer for Google under the Product Infrastructure organisation.  I find myself interested in the mathematical concepts
associated with computer science and enjoy writing library/back-end code (although I try to
at least get my feet wet in a little bit of everything).

A few things that I have been interested in lately:

* Applying deep learning methods to [decision trees](https://github.com/Quinny/DecisionForest)
* Learning functional programming abstractions with
[Î»Haskell](https://www.haskell.org)
* Implementing classic data structures in [modern c++](/blog/)
