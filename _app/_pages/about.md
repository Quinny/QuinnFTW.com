I am currently a third year student in the Honours Computer Science program at
the University of Windsor.  I am really interested in the mathematical concepts
assoicated with computer science and enjoy writing library/back-end code (although I try to
at least get my feet wet in a little bit of everything).

A few things that I have been interested in lately:

* Learning functional programming abstractions with
[Î»Haskell](https://www.haskell.org)
* Writing abstract [search algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm)
* Implementing classic data structures in [modern c++](/blog/)
