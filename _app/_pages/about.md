I currently work as a Software Engineer for Google under the Product Infrastructure organisation where I design
and build infrastructure to support people suggestion models. 
I find myself interested in the mathematical concepts
associated with computer science and enjoy writing performance sensitive backend/library code (although, I try to
at least get my feet wet in a little bit of everything). My language of expertise is C++, but I am proficient in
most mainstream programming languages (Java, Python, Go, Haskell, etc.).
